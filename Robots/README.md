# README - Robots

This is the directory that will store my Arduino robot program files I created while I waited for the first semester to end after the second completion of the first 5 chapters.

I don't want to scrounge up the files off my external hard drive today (Tuesday, July 7th 2020) so this directory will remain dorment (except for this `README.md` file) for now.
